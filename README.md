# ft_transcendence
This project is about creating a website for the mighty [Pong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong) contest!

### What is ft_transcendence?
ft_transcendence is an individual project at [42](42sp.org.br) which requires that we build an online platform to play [Pong.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong)

The backend must be built using [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/), the [frontend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontend_and_backend) in any [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) framework of your choice and the database must be [PostgreSQL.](https://www.postgresql.org/) For the [frontend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontend_and_backend), the chosen option was [React](https://reactjs.org/), due to its popularity and extensive documentation.

There are no restraints in regards to external libraries and the website but it needs to be a [single-page application.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) It should be compatible with [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en-US/chrome/) and the other optional browser.

The user must log in using the OAuth system of [42 intranet](https://intra.42.fr/) and be able to enable a [two-factor authentication](https://authy.com/what-is-2fa/) method, for which we chose the [Google Authenticator App.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en_US&gl=US)

Overall, the platform should have a ranking system, chat channels, private messages, profile editing, view users status and add other members as friends.

The platform should have a ranking system, chat channels, direct messaging and allow, user status changes, friend features and some profile customization options.

The main purpose is to play an implementation of [Pong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong), as if it was [1972.] all over again(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiShX2pTz9A) There should be a few customization options such as custom maps or power-ups but the user should still be able to play the original version.
A spectator system must be implemented, spectators are able to watch the match without interfering with it.

Finally, the server structure must be containerized using [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and available with a single call of: **docker-compose up --build**.
