powerups

- grow paddle size
- invert enemy's controls
- shrink enemy's size
- make enemy slower


----- change ball direction

-- utopia
- wind to slow ball on your direction

debuffs

- grow enemy size
- invert player controls
- shrink player size
- make player slower

========================


when a player hit the ball, it will save who was the last to touch it,
so the powerup will act in applying a buff to that player,
or a debuff to the enemy

when the ball hits a powerup, it will either activate a buff for a fixed time to
the last player to touch it, or activate a debuff for his enemy
